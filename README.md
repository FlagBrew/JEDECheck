# JEDECheck

3DS homebrew tool to check undocumented DS cartridge data.

---

I made this tool to increase the amount of DS cartridges that tools like [Checkpoint](https://www.github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint) or [PKSM](https://www.github.com/FlagBrew/PKSM) recognize as valid cartridge.

If you had issues with certain DS cartridges with the tools just mentioned, then JEDECheck is the right tool to be used to be able to send us all the data needed to support your carts in future updates.

Usage is very simple: just plug in your cartridge and run JEDECheck. If the cartridge is undocumented, a report file will be generated on your SD card.
